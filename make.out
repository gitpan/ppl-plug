Hi Andrew:

I think you should concentrate on your debugger.

I think it is a very significant tool, something that Perl has been sorely
lacking. It serves as a learning tool for the newcomer as well as a
productivity booster for the more experienced. It really helped me dive into
the dynamic data structures almost as soon as I started programming Perl,
because I could quickly find where I had screwed up.

I assume you know a lot about the Perl debugger internals and would perhaps
have some insight into how the debugger might be improved.

Regards,

Ed McGuigan.
