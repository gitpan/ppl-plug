Here are some sample plugins.  The number in parentheses represents the security
level required to run the plugin.


neko.ppl (4)	Masayuki Koba's xneko game.  You will need to install Tk::LockDisplay
		from http://www.perl.com/CPAN-local/authors/Stephen_O_Lidie/ so the
		Pixmaps are available.

plop.ppl (2)	Plot continuous functions of the form y = F(x).

y2k.ppl (2)	A countdown to the big hoedown.

thunder.ppl (2) Compute distance between you and lightning.

cube.ppl (1)	A Perl/OpenGL program by Stan Melax.  Draws a cube on your
		browser.

quest.ppl (1)	Another Perl/OpenGL by Stan.  A maze you move around in with
		your mouse.

fun.ppl (1)	And yet another by Stan.  A Startrek adventure!

ptk_test.ppl (2) A simple Perl/Tk test pattern.


In addition, there are some simple html files for cube, quest, fun and
ptk_test to illustrate how to embed them in a web page.

The cgi-bin test programs can now be found in the cgi-bin subdir.

perlplus-secure.sh.cgi -- a shell script version
perlplus-secure.perl.cgi -- same program in perl, may work with mod_perl but
                            hasn't been tried there yet.
